# Unconstrained_Optimization_Methods
This repository contains the implementation of the Newton's Method and of the nonlinear conjugate Gradient Method (NLCGM) together with a framework enabling to test them over three functions: the Chained Rosenbrock, the Ascherâ€”Russel Boundary value problem, and the Broyden Function.
